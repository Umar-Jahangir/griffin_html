                Flight is freedom in its purest form,
                <br>
                To dance with the clouds which follow a storm;
                <br>
                <br>
                To roll and glide, to wheel and spin,
                <br>
                To feel the joy that swells within;
                <br>
                <br>
                To leave the earth with its troubles and fly,
                <br>
                And know the warmth of a clear spring sky;
                <br>
                <br>
                Then back to earth at the end of a day,
                <br>
                Released from the tensions which melted away.
                <br>
                <br>
                Should my end come while I am in flight,
                <br>
                Whether brightest day or darkest night;
                <br>
                <br>
                Spare me your pity and shrug off the pain,
                <br>
                Secure in the knowledge that I'd do it again;
                <br>
                <br>
                For each of us is created to die,
                <br>
                And within me I know,
                <br>
                I was born to fly
